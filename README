This repository contains scripts for the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, used for environmental risk studies. These codes have been essential for assessing
and monitoring phenomena such as droughts, floods, and for the identification and classification of wetlands. Each script is designed to facilitate geospatial
analysis through various indices and remote sensing techniques.
